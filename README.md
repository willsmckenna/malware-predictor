# malware-predictor 1.0 
A python based project using machine learning algorithms that predicts if an executable file is malware or not.
There are several components to the project- 1) a file parser that was used to collect data, 2) a Jupyter notebook that was used to analyze the data 
and create the classifier, and 3) an app (in the folder malware_predictor) that involves user input at the command line.
